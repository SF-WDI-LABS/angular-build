Your goal is "remix" data from an API using Angular and your choice of public APIs.

### Suggested API Endpoints

* [Open Movie Database API](http://www.omdbapi.com)
* [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)
* [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api)
* [City Bikes API](http://api.citybik.es/v2/)
* [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/)
* Your Personal API!

**Do Not** Use endpoints that require AUTH or SECRET TOKENs.

> Keep in mind that *most* API endpoints are **NOT** meant to be consumed directly by the client/front-end/browser. There is *nowhere* to hide a "secret" api token in a front end application(!), so APIs like instagram, facebook, twitter, etc. are not suitable for this kind of project.


### Killer Feature
Your app should do one thing, and do it well. Here are some ideas:

* **Like it / Love it** -- toggle UI elements like buttons and icons
* **Sort it / Search it** -- make it easy to search your content
* **Bookmark it / Share it** -- use query parameters or hash state to create shareable links
* **Gameify it** -- make a quiz, flash cards, guessing game, or racing game clone.

### Highly Polished
Focus your attention on creating a seamless, highly polished, front-end user experience.

* Does the layout make sense?
* Is it "mobile first"? (Does content "reflow" correctly when the window resizes?)
* Do elements toggle correctly / intuitively?
* Could you incorporate icons/colors into your buttons?
* Did you consider edge cases?
    * Did you handle empty or incomplete API responses?
    * Did you handle bad user input into forms?
    * Did you handle API errors, not just success?
