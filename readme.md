Build an application using Angular.

### Goals

* Your app should be beautifully designed and pleasant to use. Write out user stories, draw out wireframes, and use well-designed websites as inspiration.

* Your code should be organized, and you should push your project to github with frequent, descriptive commit messages.

* Your app should include built-in angular directives, and it should only interact with the DOM through those directives.  You should not write any jQuery code yourself.

* Your app should include at least one controller with data in its `vm`.

* Your app should be interactive. Get some input from the user!

**Further Challenge Ideas**

If you'd like to go further with Angular, try these ideas!

* Create and use a custom angular directive.

* Use an <a href="https://angular-ui.github.io">angular-ui module</a> like UI-bootstrap for a UI component or feature.

* Incorporate an external angular directive *other than an angular-ui module* (for example, `ngDraggable` or `ngStorage` -- once place to browse is <a href="http://ngmodules.org">ng-modules.org</a>).

* Use data from an external API.

* Create multiple view templates and use routing to navigate.



### App Ideas

You can make any app idea you like, but it should be small enough in scope that you can build it over two days and focused enough that you can build it *well* in that time.

Here are some suggestions for app ideas that you could build:

1. Build a front-end for your personal API.
1. A pokemon tracker (did you know super-crud has [pokemon endpoints](https://super-crud.herokuapp.com/pokemon))?
1. An [API remix](api-integration.md) that integrates with some other public API.
1. [A blog!](blog.md)
1. A [dance party](dance-party.md) app with gifs and music!
1. A Stack Overflow clone with questions and answers, or even with comments and votes! (If you want to focus on Angular, use mock data.)
1. Any idea you'd like!

Depending on what you decide to build, you may not need a server. You can use data from external APIs or store data that will reset when the page loads.  When deciding whether to build a MEAN stack application, consider the following questions:

- What do you most want to practice on?
- What can you get done in the time?
- What makes sense for the app you're building?

### Deliverables

On Friday, September 23rd, you'll share what you've built!
