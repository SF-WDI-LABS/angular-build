Design and build an application from scratch using Angular.

### Goals

Make an app that is:
* thoughtfully designed
* pleasant to use
* interesting to you

On the technical side, aim for:
* modular and organized code  
* commit frequently with descriptive commit messages
* only interact with the DOM through directives (no jQuery DOM stuff)
* challenging yourself to conquer an area that's currently less clear

Remember, you've seen how to:  
* Create and use a custom angular directive.
* Create a custom service.
* Use an <a href="https://angular-ui.github.io">angular-ui module</a> like UI-bootstrap for a UI component or feature.
* Incorporate an external angular directive *other than an angular-ui module* (for example, `ngDraggable` or `ngStorage` -- once place to browse is <a href="http://ngmodules.org">ng-modules.org</a>).
* Use data from an external API.
* Create multiple view templates and use routing to navigate.
* Build your own full-fledged back end with a server and database. 

### App Ideas

You can make any app idea you like, but it must be small enough in scope that you can build it over two days and focused enough that you can build it *well* in that time.

Here are some suggestions for app ideas that you could build:

1. A front-end for your personal API.
1. An [API remix](api-integration.md) that integrates with some other public API.
1. A [blog!](blog.md).
1. A [dance party](dance-party.md) app with gifs and music.
1. Any idea you'd like!

Depending on what you decide to build, you may not need a server. You can use data from external APIs or store data that will reset when the page loads.  When deciding whether to build a MEAN stack application, consider the following questions:

- What do you most want to practice on?
- What can you get done in the time?
- What makes sense for the app you're building?


### Deliverables

**A GitHub repository for the project with frequent commits and a README.**

**A small but working "skateboard" version of your app on the master branch.**

On Friday, September 23rd, you'll share what you've built!
