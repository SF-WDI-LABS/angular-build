Design and build an application from scratch using Angular or React.

### Goals

Make an app that:
* is thoughtfully designed
* is pleasant to use
* shows off your skills with Angular or React

While developing, consider:
* modular and organized code  
* frequent commits with descriptive commit messages
* only interacting with the DOM through your FEF (no jQuery DOM interaction)
* challenging yourself to conquer an area that's currently less clear

### Technical Requirements

These requirements will help ensure you build an interactive prototype that demonstrates your ability with Angular/React. You are not required to build a fully-fledged CRUD app.


Minimum requirements:
* Create an angular app with custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
* Use client-side routing to create and route at least two pages with different view templates.
* Create at least two components that display different data (one for each view, and any extra needed).
* Create an express server to serve your front-end files (main HTML, template HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, assets...).


If appropriate for your app, you may need or want to:
* Create a custom angular directive.
* Create a custom service.
* Use an <a href="https://angular-ui.github.io">angular-ui module</a> like UI-bootstrap for a UI component or feature.
* Incorporate an external Angular or React component *other than an angular-ui module* (for example, `ngDraggable` or `ngStorage` -- once place to browse is <a href="http://ngmodules.org">ng-modules.org</a>).
* Use data from an external API.
* Build a database with models to store your own data.

### Scope

You may come up with a large plan. It is your responsibility to divide that plan into small, manageable parts and build them one at a time.

### Deliverables

**A GitHub repository for the project with frequent commits and a README.**

**A working prototype version of your app on the master branch.**

**A working prototype version of your app deployed on Heroku.** This should be linked in your README.

Today, at 4:00pm, you'll check in to show off an initial version, get feedback, ask questions, etc.

Next class, we'll have science-fair style presentations of your work, so your classmates can see what they've built!
